a very naive implementation of a markdown parser, supposed to be a leaning project of Go Language.

it doesn't use any Regex just simple string manipulation.

## Features

it's able to parse only block elements:

- Paragraph
- Headings (using `#`)
- Blockquote
- Horizontal line
- Unordered List
- Ordered List (1 level only.)
